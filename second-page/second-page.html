                                    as well as influences from West African cultures. The costume has elements of
                                    European dress (laced back bodice, puffed sleeves, long full skirts) as
                                    well as elements of West African dress (head wrap, V neck split sided short sleeved
                                    shirt). These costumes also include details that have changed and developed for
                                    practical purposes i.e. the lap skirt; which was for the purpose of protecting the
                                    dress from dirt, and the soda wrap which was for carrying cane soda used to

                                    sugar cane fields.
