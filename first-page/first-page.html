                    Saint Kitts and Nevis is a dual-island nation situated between the Atlantic Ocean and
                    Caribbean Sea. It's known for cloud-shrouded mountains and beaches. Many of its former
                    sugar plantations are now inns or atmospheric ruins. The larger of the 2 islands, Saint
                    Kitts, is dominated by the dormant Mount Liamuiga volcano, home to a crater lake, green
                    vervet monkeys and rainforest crisscrossed with hiking trails.

                                    the shore are the result of flowing lava, now forever frozen in time.
                                    The lava came from the strato volcano Mount Liamuiga, also known as Mount Misery. If

                                    views are even more stunning.
                                    Waves smash into the rocks with savage force; Mother
                                     Nature hosts quite a show here. ‘Don’t you mess with me,’ she says. ‘I’ll always win.’
                                     The action of winds and ocean waves have created incredible rock formations with
                                    unusual shapes. 
                                    There are natural pools that you can climb down into just enjoy the sound and spray
                                    from the ocean crashing against the rocks.

                            the center of commerce—albeit a darker business in years past. A careful look at the
                            surrounding historic buildings reveals places where slaves were held prior to being
                            auctioned off in the square. Today, however, an ornate fountain stands at the center of
                            the park, and the grassy areas play host to parties and public gatherings.
                            Although decorative, the primary purpose was to supply fresh water for the townspeople. The 
                            water was piped in from Olivees Mountain. On top of the basin are three maidens and a boy

                                 of Saint Kitts, as well as one of the tallest peaks in the eastern Caribbean archipelago.
                                 The peak is topped by a 0.6-mile wide summit crater. The last verified
                                 eruptions from the volcano were about 1,800 years ago. Mount Liamuiga was formerly
                                 named Mount Misery and was renamed on the date of St. Kitts' independence,
                                 September 19, 1983. Many older citizens still refer to it as Mount Misery.
                                 The name Liamuiga is derived from the Kalinago name for the entire island of St.

                                    St. Kitts and Nevis’ National Carnival, affectionately known as Sugar Mas, takes
                                    place between the months of November and January with its main events such as
                                    J’ouvert taking place on the day after Christmas, Parade Day happening on New Year’s
                                    Day, and Last Lap on the second day of the new year. Sugar Mas is a great way to
                                    learn and experience both traditional folklore and modern-day carnival. Folklore
                                    performances such as masquerade are evident throughout Sugar Mas. n addition to
                                    events held by the National Carnival Committee, there is an entire calendar of
                                    fringe events and fetes. The National Carnival Committee also puts on pageantry
                                    shows such as Miss National Carnival and Miss National Swimwear. There are also
                                    traditional Calypso shows as well as Soca Monarch shows.">

                                work their way, on one foot, towards each other in the centre of the ring where they
                                perform a Fertility Dance that can be traced to the mating dance of Africa.
                                3) The Wild Mas - dancers throw their tomahawks into the air. This dance is typical 
                                of the African war dance.
                                4) The Jig - dancers
                                display their skill with the tomahawk, with their right foot hooked behind their left.
                                5) The Boillola - the tomahawk
                                is held between the dancer's legs, while the dancers jump and clap to the music, moving
                                from side to side. European roots are paraded when the dancers pair off into
                                couples and perform the Waltz to a moderately fast triple meter.">

                                    For hundreds of years our Clowns have been a big part of our cultural festivals.
                                    This troupe of up to fifty players wear floppy, colorful costumes decorated with

                                    the rhythms of their accompanying String Band. In the same tradition of all local
                                    folk dances, our clowns wear pink wire mesh masks to hide their identity and allow
                                    for total lack of inhibition. As they serpentine behind and between each other, the

                                stage play. In St. Kitts, “The Actors” is a group of acrobats engaged in a series of
                                daring somersaults over a large upturned garden fork. They
                                perform skilful, hair-raising acrobatic feats. In addition to the somersaults done over
                                the prongs of an upturned garden fork, the actors place a big stone on the chest of one
                                of the acrobats and the stone is broken with a sledge hammer.
                                Throughout the years, Kittitians have taken their traditions and customs and woven them
                                into a unique pageantry displaying them for all to see mainly during the Carnival
                                celebration at Christmas time. If we lose these traditions and customs then we would
                                have lost a vital part of our inheritance and our existence.">
